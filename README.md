# bean jump 2
the long-awaited sequel to [bean jump](https://bleps.ch/beanjump), now with an environmental awareness twist

## todo:
- get the base game working
- replace the models with environmentally appropriate symbols (cars / trash / pollution for enemies, maybe change the bean to a little earth?)
- background image starts out as a polluted wasteland, improves as the game progresses
- experiment with a double jump and/or fast falling mechanic while spacing enemies out further
- highscores database
- make some power-ups
