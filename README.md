# bean jump 2
the long-awaited sequel to [bean jump](https://bleps.ch/beanjump), now with an environmental awareness twist

## todo:
- ~~make jump height variable depending on how long you hold the jump key
- increase gravity while holding the down key~~
- make some power-ups -- double jump, score multipliers
- replace the models with environmentally appropriate symbols (cars / trash / pollution for enemies, maybe change the bean to a little earth?)
- background image starts out as a polluted wasteland, improves as the game progresses
- highscores database
